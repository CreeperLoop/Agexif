## Agexif

###What is it? 
It is a tiny programming project to read and batch-process the EXIF metadata of image files. 

###Why it is called Agexif? 
As a user of film camera(s), I always bothered when attempting to insert the exposure info for each image *Stück für Stück*. **Ag** is a commonly found element in B&W film except processed Ilford XP2. 

###License
This project currently uses GPLv3 license.
